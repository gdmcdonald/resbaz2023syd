Woohoo! We are so proud to present our three day online program of talks, workshops and demonstrations for ResBaz Sydney 23-25 November 2021.

Our program has a dizzying array of informative sessions on programming tools, tips and tricks, compute platforms and practical guides to working with surveys and data collection.

ResBaz is not a typical academic conference. Instead of keynotes we invite people to share a keystory on a topic they’re passionate about and what got them there. The keystories start on Tuesday with Dr Taren Sanders and Prof Philip Parker (ACU) sharing how they do reproducible research, with a practical discussion of workflows and tools that you can use too. On Wednesday we have a double feature, starting with Dr Anusuriya Devaraju (UQ) on simple steps to effective scientific data sharing. Later in the day we will join QLD ResBaz for their livestream keystory A/Prof Tim Sherratt talking about his GLAM Workbench, and building tools to explore humanities datasets. Our final keystory on Thursday is Prof Raina MacIntyre (UNSW) from Epiwatch talking about using Artificial Intelligence to prevent the next pandemic.

Registration for ResBaz is slightly tricky, so we’ve staggered the process. 

Step 1. We encourage all participants to [register for a general ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/resbaz-sydney-2021-tickets-169068026017), which will give you access to all the keystories, talks and practical demonstration, across all five streams. So you can dip in an out across the whole program. These sessions have a pretty large capacity, thanks to our awesome partner [AARNET](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/) who is providing the zoom.

Step 2. Sign up for individual workshops. This opens on Monday 18 October. Workshop seats are limited. In order to balance participation across our collaborating institutions, everyone joins a waitlist for each workshop. Tickets will be released a couple of weeks before ResBaz starts.

So what are you waiting for? Check out the [program](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2021/sydney/program/) and [join us](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/resbaz-sydney-2021-tickets-169068026017)!
