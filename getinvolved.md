#### What's this all about?

ResBaz Sydney is a community-focussed event on digital tools and training for researchers, and there are a lot of different ways you can become involved. 

To keep up to date with ResBaz news and find out when registrations open for November 2021, you can [join our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hGWsUH).

#### Join as learner

When registration opens (September 2021), you can select across our program of talks, workshops and social spaces. We encourage our learners and participants to contribute virtual posters of yourself and your digital toolbox, this makes it easy to build connections and find your people. 

#### Share your knowledge 

Have you discovered a cool hack or sweet workflow that you'd like to share? Maybe you'd like to share what you wished you'd learnt when you started to learn programming? Our program features key stories, panel sessions and lightning talks, where participants can share tips and tricks relating to digital tools in your research. [Get in touch with our EOI form](https://forms.gle/7SQJKgi4YfbyxUJz5) (it's short!)

#### Become a volunteer

As ResBaz is highly participatory, we rely on volunteers especially in the online environment to support our instructors, guide participants and help manage the social spaces. If joining in this way resonates with you, we would love to have you on board! [Get in touch with our EOI form](https://forms.gle/7SQJKgi4YfbyxUJz5) 

#### Run a workshop

Digital skills workshops are the backbone of ResBaz. If you're a Carpentries instructor, or have experience running digital skills workshops for researchers, we invite you to run a taster workshop or demonstration session at ResBaz. As we're going online this year, we're focussing on a shorter workshop format, rather than the long-form half day sessions. These are practical information sessions where you can introduce learners to your training offerings. [Get in touch with our EOI form](https://forms.gle/7SQJKgi4YfbyxUJz5) 

#### Become a partner

The Sydney ResBaz Committee is a multi institutional collaborative endeavour. We are supported by industry and institutional partners who make it all possible! Talk to us about how you can partner with us and be part of our next generation research community. [Get in touch with our EOI form](https://forms.gle/7SQJKgi4YfbyxUJz5)
