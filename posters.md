#### Digital tools posters
We encourage everyone who is part of ResBaz to create a digital poster which describes yourself, your projects and digital toolkits. Feel free to use the sample posters or the [Best of Melbourne 2015 Posters](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZimD_kIxdUf9UucO0H_JdUmTZhye0o5IrW4lWpOQO2c/edit#slide=id.g6d4564c7a_30) for ideas.

Please do not stress about creating a poster! It's completely fine if you only have a few things to list. The point of this is simply to start conversations about the tools that we use or are interested in and help people with complementary interests find each other.

Posters will be displayed during the ResBaz Hacky Hour in gather.town and people will get to chat with you about your project, tools and challenges.

#### How to submit your poster

[Open up the poster template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SBVHuiI5zEDDl6roP-38xzW15lMoT9bg59lxXvA0M0k/edit#slide=id.gfd030064e4_0_41). Duplicate the poster (slide 2) template on the next page: Right click + select ‘Duplicate slide’ (Please don’t edit the template - keep slide 2 generic so others can use it!)

Populate the duplicate slide with your own content (check the other posters from this slideshow for ideas)

Do this by 22 November 2021.
