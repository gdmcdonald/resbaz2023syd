  description: "The Single Cell App is a cloud-based application that allows visualisation and comparison of scRNA-seq data and is scalable according to use. Users upload their own or publicly available scRNA-seq datasets after pre-processing to be visualised using a web browser. The data can be viewed in two colour modes, Cluster - representing cell identity, and Values – level of expression, and data queried using keyword or gene identification number(s). Using the app to compare four different studies we determined that some genes frequently used as cell-type markers are in fact study specific. These differences, identified using the Single Cell App, highlight the need for resources to enable researchers to find common and different patterns of cell specific gene expression. Thus, the Single Cell App enables researchers to form new hypothesis, perform comparative studies, allows for easy re-use of data for this emerging technology to provide novel avenues to crop improvement."

  description: "Data is an important research asset for the reproducibility of scientific results. However, researchers are often trapped in data sharing dilemmas caused due to several factors such as lack of awareness and support programs, variation in data sharing practices, privacy concerns, and discrepancies in incentives to collaborate around data between data creators, service providers, and users. This presentation will cover a set of simple steps to help researchers share their data effectively through open data repositories.  These steps are derived from my professional experience in provisioning and consuming research datasets over the last 15 years. They are based on generally applicable data characteristics and can be potentially applied at different stages of the research data lifecycle."

  description: "Researchers and scientists is an extremely diverse community and Humanities/Social Sciences itself may include Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, Linguistics, Social Work, Anthropology. Other fields, though recognized to be in their own, may still loosely fall under Humanities/Social Sciences such as History, Economics, Education, Law, Geography, not to mention Medical Science research. In all these areas, data are important for empirical studies, to develop theories, to validate or invalidate existing theories. Researchers often learn new computing technology or coding to extract, prepare and transform data. Many hours and effort are spend developing IT skills just to get the data in the right form, instead of developing their scientific skills. Monarch is the tool that has saved hours and days of tedious data preparation work for over 30 years in the commercial sector. It would no doubt be as helpful for researchers today who are faced with ever increasing volumes of data."

  description: "The Australian Research Data Common (ARDC) Institutional Underpinnings (IU) program aims to develop a jointly-agreed framework for Research Data Management (RDM) practices. As part of this program, Bond University, University of New South Wales and University of Sydney will be developing and pilot testing a Principledly-Aligned Institutionally-Contextualised (PAIC) RDM introductory educational/training experience for Higher Degree Research (HDR) candidates. At the end of the program, the experience will be made available to other institutions to implement and customise based on their policies, systems and processes, while still espousing common RDM principles (e.g. sharing data safely). It is envisaged that once the PAIC experience is implemented by institutions nationwide, it will result in a ‘standardised’ RDM training for HDR candidates, which will raise their awareness of RDM best practices to a common baseline. This baseline awareness will assist them in making informed decisions around managing their data, and facilitate cross-institutional management of data (e.g. having common RDM expectations when moving between institutions). To ensure that the PAIC experience is effective and engaging, the experience must be designed to be relevant and useful for the HDR candidates (i.e. contextualised content that allows them to start RDM planning and enact RDM best practices relevant to their early project phase in their institutions) (Oo, Chew, Wong, Gladding, & Stenstrom, 2021). This presentation will (1) outline the design and development of the PAIC experience, (2) present the first iteration of the PAIC RDM focus areas, and (3) share findings from the PAIC prototype."
