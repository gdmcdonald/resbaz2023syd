- description: This presentation delves into an innovative study that establishes
    a standardized approach following accredited clinical genome testing for genetic
    diseases. Our research, centered around 499 individuals with genetic heart ailments
    in Australia, employs advanced bioinformatics analysis and lab-based functional
    assessments. Notably, we identified additional disease-causing variations in 10
    previously undiagnosed participants. The results show that a combination of secondary
    bioinformatics analysis and lab studies can better identify the cause of inherited
    heart diseases, leading to improved diagnoses and better management for affected
    individuals and their family members.

- description: This presentation will explore techniques in Systemic Functional Linguistics
    (SFL), the study of the relationship between language and its social context,
    for analysing qualitative data. In particular,this presentation will address how
    SFL intersects with new advances in generative artificial intelligence and natural
    language processing (NLP). The examples in this presentation relate to social
    media data, covering the collection of social media data, the development of social
    media corpora using corpus linguistic tools, and how manual SFL analyses and automated
    NLP analyses can intersect. The overall aim of this presentation is to introduce
    the audience to SFL and provide a number of resources and tools for researchers
    interested in this particular methodology and its future.
