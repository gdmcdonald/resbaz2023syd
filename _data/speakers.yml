  bio: "Dietmar M\xFCller is Professor of Geophysics at the School of Geosciences,\
    \ University of Sydney. He received his undergraduate degree from the Univ. of\
    \ Kiel, Germany, and his PhD in Earth Science from the Scripps Institution of\
    \ Oceanography, UC San Diego/California in 1993. After joining the University\
    \ of Sydney he built the EarthByte Research Group, pursuing geodata synthesis\
    \ and modelling through space and time.  The EarthByte Group's virtual globe software,\
    \ recently shortlisted for a Eureka Award, has a myriad of applications from providing\
    \ boundary conditions for high-performance computing Earth evolution models to\
    \ critical mineral exploration with end-users in over 190 countries.  Dietmar\
    \ currently leads STELLAR, a multi-year industry project aimed at developing big\
    \ and complex spatio-temporal data analysis and modelling to support the energy\
    \ transition and critical mineral exploration exploration. He held an Australian\
    \ Laureate Fellowship from 2009-2014, and is a Fellow of the Australian Academy\
    \ of Science and the American Geophysical Union."
